title: "Account Deployment"
---

The SDK handles the account deployments for you. When transacting on a new chain for the first time, the account will be deployed as part of the intent. The Orchestrator automatically detects if the account needs to be deployed, then passes the init data to the relayer market as part of the intent, which is then exectuted by a relayer.

It's possible to make the deployment completely gasless for the user if you're using [sponsorships](../gas-sponsorship/overview).

Otherwise, the user needs to have some tokens on either the chain you're deploying to, or any other [supported chain](../../home/resources/supported-chains) (provided the account is already deployed there).

## Check Status

You can check if the account is deployed on a specific chain:

```ts
await rhinestoneAccount.isDeployed(chain)
```

## Manual Deployments

You can manually trigger an account deployment on any chain:

```ts
await rhinestoneAccount.deploy(chain)
```

You can also sponsor the gas:

```ts
await rhinestoneAccount.deploy(
  chain,
  {
    sponsored: true
  }
)
```

## Deploy from Another Account

You can deploy an account from another smart account using the `deploy` action. This can be useful when you want to pay for a deployment with another account:

```ts
import { deploy } from '@rhinestone/sdk/actions'

// Account that will be deployed
const newAccount = await rhinestone.createAccount({
  owners: { type: 'ecdsa', accounts: [newOwner] },
})

// Deploy newAccount from an existing sponsor account
await sponsorAccount.sendTransaction({
  chain,
  calls: [deploy(newAccount)],
})
```
