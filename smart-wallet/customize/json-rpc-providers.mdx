title: "JSON-RPC providers"
---

By default, the SDK uses public providers to make EVM read calls.

Many public providers are heavily throttled and are not suitable for high traffic.

For production use, we recommend setting up a custom JSON-RPC provider with your own API key.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Alchemy">

To use [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com), provide an API key during SDK initialization:

```ts {2-6}
const rhinestone = new RhinestoneSDK({
  apiKey: rhinestoneApiKey,
  provider: {
    type: 'alchemy',
    apiKey: alchemyApiKey,
  }
})
const rhinestoneAccount = await rhinestone.createAccount({
  owners: {
    type: 'ecdsa',
    accounts: [accountA, accountB, accountC],
    threshold: 2,
  },

})
```

</Tab>
<Tab title="Custom URLs">

To use custom JSON-RPC URLs, provide a mapping of chain IDs to RPC URLs:

```ts {2-9}
const rhinestone = new RhinestoneSDK({
  provider: {
    type: 'custom',
    urls: {
      1: 'https://my-rpc.example.com/eth',
      8453: 'https://my-rpc.example.com/base',
      42161: 'https://my-rpc.example.com/arb',
    },
  },
})
const rhinestoneAccount = await rhinestone.createAccount({
  owners: {
    type: 'ecdsa',
    accounts: [account],
  },
})
```
