title: "JSON-RPC providers"
---

By default, the SDK uses public providers to make EVM read calls.

Many public providers are heavily throttled and are not suitable for high traffic.

For production use, we recommend setting up a custom JSON-RPC provider with your own API key.

<Tab title="Alchemy">

To use [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com), provide an API key during SDK initialization:

```ts {2-6}
const rhinestone = new RhinestoneSDK({
  apiKey: rhinestoneApiKey,
  provider: {
    type: 'alchemy',
    apiKey: alchemyApiKey,
  }
})
const rhinestoneAccount = await rhinestone.createAccount({
  owners: {
    type: 'ecdsa',
    accounts: [accountA, accountB, accountC],
    threshold: 2,
  },

})
```
