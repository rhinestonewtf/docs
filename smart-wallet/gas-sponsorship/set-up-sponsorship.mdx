Rhinestone lets you sponsor your user's activity by topping up a single onchain account ("gas tank").

You can manage your sponsorship balance in the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.rhinestone.dev).

## Viewing your balance

To see your sponsorship balance, open the "Sponsorship" tab:

## Topping up

On the same page, you can also top up your balance by sending USDC on Base to the deposit contract.

There are two ways to top up:

1. Using the deposit modal with the connected wallet
2. Making a token transfer manually with your wallet of choice

### Using the modal

The easiest way to increase your balance is to use the deposit modal.

To start, press the "Deposit" button:

</Frame>

Approve the transaction in your wallet:

</Frame>

Once your transaction is complete, your balance will automatically update.

### Manual deposits

You can deposit the tokens directly using your wallet.

This can be useful if you need to use an external wallet (e.g., Safe or mobile wallet).

To start, press the "Copy" button to copy your address:

Open your wallet to initiate the tranfer transaction:

<Warning>Make sure to **only send USDC on Base**. Any other token would not be credited towards the sponsorship balance.</Warning>

Once your transaction is complete, your balance will automatically update.
