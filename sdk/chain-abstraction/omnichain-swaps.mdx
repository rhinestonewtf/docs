Omni Account can automatically swap your tokens when executing the transaction.

Say, you only have USDC on Base but want to transact with ETH on Arbitrum. In that case, you only need to specify the required tokens on the target chain, and Omni Account will do the bridging and the swap in one go.

To make your first cross-chain swap, make sure that:

1) The account is deployed on [any chain](../../home/introduction/supported-chains).
2) The account has at least one of the [supported assets](../../home/introduction/supported-chains) on the chain with the deployed account.

```ts
const ethTarget = getTokenAddress('ETH', arbitrumSepolia.id)
const ethAmount = 2n
const receiver = '0xd8da6bf26964af9d7eed9e03e53415d37aa96045'

const transaction = await rhinestoneAccount.sendTransaction({
  sourceChains: [baseSepolia],
  targetChain: arbitrumSepolia,
  calls: [
    {
      to: receiver,
      value: ethAmount,
    },
  ],
  tokenRequests: [
    {
      address: ethTarget,
      amount: ethAmount,
    },
  ],
})
```

Assuming you had USDC on Base Sepolia, this will swap some of that USDC to ETH, send it to Arbitrum Sepolia, and execute the transfer transaction.

<Note>Make sure the token address in `calls` and `tokenRequests` corresponds to the _target_ chain.</Note>
