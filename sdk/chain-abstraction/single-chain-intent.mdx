description: "Use intents to create same-chain transactions"
---

Single-chain intents let you make transactions on a chain of your choice.

These intents are similar to ERC-4337 User Operations. See our [concepts section on intents vs userops](../../home/concepts/chain-abstraction#general-purpose-transaction-infrastructure) to better understand the difference.

On a high level, single-chain intents are executed by relayers through the intent executor module, similar to how other smart account transactions are executed (e.g., via userops).

## Example

Here's how you can make a token transfer:

```ts
const singleChainTx = await rhinestoneAccount.sendTransaction({
  chain: base,
  calls: [
    {
      to: 'USDC',
      data: encodeFunctionData({
        abi: erc20Abi,
        functionName: 'transfer',
        args: [recipient, parseUnits('5', 6)],
      }),
    },
  ],
})
```
