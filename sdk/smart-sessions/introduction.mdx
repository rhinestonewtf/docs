## Overview

Session keys are cryptographically signed keys generated by a user’s master key (passkey, ECDSA, or multisig). Smart Sessions enables session keys to be created and used with all major smart account implementations (via ERC-7579) and is fully compatible with Rhinestone’s Omni Account transaction infrastructure. 

Examples of the onchain permissions that can be tailored with Smart Sessions include:

* Interacting only with a specific DeFi protocol (Aave or Uniswap)  
* Spending limits on ERC20s or ETH  
* Timeframes for expiry after a pre-determined period  
* Combining permissions (e.g., Uniswap-only, 1000 USDC limit, 3-day expiry)

Key example use cases include:

* **Skipping confirmations:** Store a session key locally for “one-click trading,” allowing seamless decentralized application (dapp) interactions without repeated signing prompts.  
* **Automating transactions:** Users share a scoped key for server-side execution, enabling:  
  * Subscription payments  
  * Limit orders or stop orders  
  * Auto-repaying loans to prevent liquidation

This granular control enhances security, streamlines dapp interactions, and makes Web3 more user-friendly.

## Security

Smart Sessions is a powerful tool that unlocks a bunch of new opportunities and use cases. To keep your users secure when using sessions, follow these guidelines:

* Store the session key securely. Depending on the use case, you can opt to store it in the browser or on your backend. Consider key management solutions like [KMS](https://aws.amazon.com/kms/) or [Lit Protocol](https://www.litprotocol.com).  
* Stick to the [principle of least privilege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege): do not request more actions than you need.  
* Guard your smart session with granular policies (e.g., restrict the amount of ETH that can be transacted through the session)  
* If possible, timebox your session (e.g., make it valid for only 1 week)

<Warning>By default, the SDK creates a session that allows any transaction. Make sure you restrict it with relevant actions and policies.</Warning>
