description: Use Rhinestone with an existing account
---

By default, the Rhinestone SDK deploys a new smart account for each. However, you can use a smart account you've already created for a user (for example, using another SDK like permissionless.js) by providing custom deployment data.

<Note>This feature is **experimental**. Reach out to us if you have any issues or feature requests.</Note>

## Account Creation

When creating an account instance, you will need to provide the factory data you've used to deploy the account.

### Init Data

The factory data depends on the SDK you've used to create an account, as well as on the account configuration itself (account type and version, and installed modules).

Reach out to us if you need help generating the init data for your account configuration.

### Account Address

You will also need to provide the address of the account you're using. The SDK uses this for cross-reference to make sure it understands your account configuration.

### Intent Executor

Unless you were using the Rhinestone SDK V0 before, the accounts you have won't have the Rhinestone Intent Executor installed.

### Example

To reuse an existing account, pass an `initData` when creating an account:

```ts {10-15}
const rhinestoneAccount = await rhinestone.createAccount({
  account: {
    type: 'kernel',
  },
  owners: {
    type: 'ecdsa',
    accounts: [accountA],
    module: '0x2483DA3A338895199E5e538530213157e931Bf06',
  },
  initData: {
    address: accountAddress,
    factory,
    factoryData,
    intentExecutorInstalled: false,
  },
})
```

## Legacy Modules

In most cases, an existing account would probably have the [legacy modules](../../home/resources/address-book#legacy) installed. In this case, you need to explicitly specify the module address when setting the `owners`.

```ts {5-6}
const rhinestoneAccount = await rhinestone.createAccount({
  owners: {
    type: 'ecdsa',
    accounts: [accountA],
    // Legacy ownable validator module
    module: '0x2483DA3A338895199E5e538530213157e931Bf06',
  },
})
```

## Deployments

On the chains where the account is not yet deployed, you will need to explicitly call the `deploy` function. This will use the provided init data and deploy the account to the same address.

This is done once per chain, per account.

This will be done using an ERC-4337 UserOp (unless you have the intent executor as part of the init data).

To deploy an account:

```ts
await rhinestoneAccount.deploy(chain)
```

## Account Setup

To be able to use an existing account with the SDK, you will need to set it up.

This is done once per chain, per account.

Specifically, this installs the intent executor and the necessary validators (if needed).

This will be done using an ERC-4337 UserOp (unless you have the intent executor as part of the init data).

```ts
await rhinestoneAccount.setup(chain)
```
