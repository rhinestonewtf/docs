description: "Make cross-chain transactions with intents"

Multi-chain intents let you make cross-chain transactions.

Those intents specify both the target (destination) and the source chain(s). The actual transaction (_fill_) happens on the target chain, while the funds are taken on the source chains (_claims_). Specifying source chains is optional — Rhinestone finds the optimal path automatically.

Multi-chain intents work similarly to single-chain intents, but with the introduction of settlement layers. From your perspective, making cross-chain transactions is as simple as making normal Ethereum transactions. The Rhinestone Orchestrator handles path finding, liquidity management, and intent execution for you.

Learn more about how Rhinestone intents work [here](../../home/introduction/rhinestone-intents).

## Example

We will make a cross-chain token transfer using multi-chain intents.

```tsx
const amount = parseUnits('100', 6) // 100 USDC

const transferIntent = await rhinestoneAccount.sendTransaction({
  sourceChains: [base],
  targetChain: arbitrum,
  calls: [
    {
      to: 'USDC',
      data: encodeFunctionData({
        abi: erc20Abi,
        functionName: 'transfer',
        args: [recipient, amount],
      }),
    },
  ],
  tokenRequests: [
    {
      address: 'USDC',
      amount,
    },
  ],
})
```

Under the hood, this will:

1) Get a quote from the Rhinestone backend
2) Sign the intent using the account owner(s)
3) Submit the intent
4) Execute the _claim_ transaction on Arbitrum
5) Execute the _fill_ transaction on Base

## Monitor Execution

You can wait until the target chain transaction is submitted to the blockchain:

```tsx
const result = await rhinestoneAccount.waitForExecution(transferIntent)
console.log('Status:', result.status)
```

## Token Requests

`tokenRequests` is a list of token assets and their amounts that are required on the target chain to make the transaction. It tells the solvers to ensure those assets are present before executing the transaction `calls`. If you don't need any assets on the target chain, you can omit this.

<Note>Solvers will supply all assets specified in the `tokenRequests`. If the user already has the required assets, don't add them into `tokenRequests`.</Note>

## Source Chain

Providing the source chain deploys the account on that chain, as well as uses the funds on that chain to fulfill the intent.

If you already have an account deployed on one or more source chains, you can omit the `sourceChain`. In that case, the orchestrator will use the best chain(s) to source funds.

## Token Requests

`tokenRequests` is a list of token assets and their amounts that are required on the target chain to make the transaction. It tells the solvers to ensure those assets are present before executing the transaction `calls`. If you don't need any assets on the target chain, you can omit this.

<Note>Solvers will supply all assets specified in the `tokenRequests`. If the user already has the required assets, don't add them into `tokenRequests`.</Note>

## Gas Limit

You can override the default gas limit for the target chain execution with `gasLimit`. Doing this will make the intent better priced, because we can more accurately calculate the fee that a solver needs to be reimbursed with for paying the gas. If this is not provided, we calculate using a gas limit of `1_000_000`.

```ts {10}
const transaction = await rhinestoneAccount.sendTransaction({
  sourceChains: [base],
  targetChain: arbitrum,
  calls: [
    // …
  ],
  tokenRequests: [
    // …
  ],
  gasLimit: 200_000n,
})
```

## Source Assets

You can specify what token (or tokens) to use as an input asset:

```ts {10}
const transaction = await rhinestoneAccount.sendTransaction({
  sourceChains: [base],
  targetChain: arbitrum,
  calls: [
    // …
  ],
  tokenRequests: [
    // …
  ],
  sourceAssets: ['USDC', 'ETH']
})
```

You can also specify source assets on a per-chain basis:

```ts {9-12}
const transaction = await rhinestoneAccount.sendTransaction({
  targetChain: arbitrum,
  calls: [
    // …
  ],
  tokenRequests: [
    // …
  ],
  sourceAssets: {
    [base.id]: ['USDC'],
    [optimism.id]: ['0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000006'], // WETH
  },
})
```

<Note>Chain-specific `sourceAssets` take precendence over `sourceChain` parameter.</Note>

## Fee Asset

You can choose what asset to use as a fee token (i.e., to cover gas and bridging fees):

```ts {10}
const transaction = await rhinestoneAccount.sendTransaction({
  sourceChains: [base],
  targetChain: arbitrum,
  calls: [
    // …
  ],
  tokenRequests: [
    // …
  ],
  feeAsset: 'USDC',
})
```
