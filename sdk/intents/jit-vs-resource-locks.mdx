description: "Understanding Rhinestone's dual-mode execution: Just-In-Time flow versus Fill-First flow with The Compact."
---

## Overview

Rhinestone supports two funding strategies depending on execution needs:
- **JIT (unlocked funds)**: Tokens are sourced at execution time
- **Resource locks (locked funds)**: Funds may be reserved ahead of execution

## Execution Strategies

```tsx
const result = await rhinestoneAccount.sendTransaction({
  sourceChains: [arbitrum],
  targetChain: base,
  calls: [
    {
      to: baseUSDC,
      data: encodeFunctionData({
        abi: erc20Abi,
        functionName: 'transfer',
        args: [recipient, amount],
      }),
    },
  ],
  tokenRequests: [
    { address: baseUSDC, amount: parseUnits('100', 6) },
  ],
})
```

<Note>The choice of JIT vs locked funds is handled internally by the infrastructure based on the request and environment. No additional configuration is required in the SDK.</Note>
