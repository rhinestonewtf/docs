description: "Use intents to create same-chain transactions"

Single-chain intents let you make transactions on a chain of your choice.

These intents are similar to ERC-4337 User Operations. See our [concepts section on intents vs userops](../../home/concepts/intents-and-erc4337) to better understand the difference.

Relayers execute single-chain intents through the intent executor module. For a breakdown of the high-level flow, please take a look at the [Rhinestone Intents concepts section](../../home/introduction/rhinestone-intents).

## Example

Here's how you can make a token transfer:

```ts
const singleChainTx = await rhinestoneAccount.sendTransaction({
  chain: base,
  calls: [
    {
      to: 'USDC',
      data: encodeFunctionData({
        abi: erc20Abi,
        functionName: 'transfer',
        args: [recipient, parseUnits('5', 6)],
      }),
    },
  ],
})
```
