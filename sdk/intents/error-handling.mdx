## SDK Errors

Account errors:

* `Eip7702AccountMustHaveEoaError`: when using EIP-7702, you need to provide an EOA account by passing `eoa` param.
* `SigningNotSupportedForAccountError`: the account you provided does not support message signing.
* `WalletClientNoConnectedAccountError`: the `WalletClient` instance you provided is missing a default account. Ensure the wallet is connected and the client has an account.
* `Eip7702NotSupportedForAccountError`: this account type does not support EIP-7702. Try using a different account implementation or [submit](https://github.com/rhinestonewtf/sdk/issues) a feature request.
* `AccountConfigurationNotSupportedError`: your account setup is not currently supported. Try using a different account configuration or [submit](https://github.com/rhinestonewtf/sdk/issues) a feature request.
* `FactoryArgsNotAvailableError`: factory data is not available for this type of account. Most likely an issue with the SDK itself. Please [submit](https://github.com/rhinestonewtf/sdk/issues) a bug report.
* `SmartSessionsNotEnabledError`: smart session validator is not available. Most likely an issue with the SDK itself. Please [submit](https://github.com/rhinestonewtf/sdk/issues) a bug report.

Execution errors:

* `SourceChainsNotAvailableForUserOpFlowError`: when using a UserOp flow (e.g., for account recovery), you need to provide a source chain.
* `UserOperationRequiredForSmartSessionsError`: when using smart sessions, you need to use the UserOp flow.
* `SessionChainRequiredError`: when using smart sessions, each session needs to define a chain where it is activated.
* `IntentFailedError`: the intent failed (reverted onchain). A common reason is that a swap failed due to price action.
* `SimulationNotSupportedForUserOpFlowError`: `simulateTransaction` can only simulate intents.
* `OrderPathRequiredForIntentsError`: when sending an intent, you need to first get the path. When using `submitTransaction`, make sure to call `prepareTransaction` first.

Orchestrator errors:

* `InsufficientBalanceError`: the account doesn't have enough funds. See [Insufficient Balance](#insufficient-balance).
* `UnsupportedChainIdError`: this chain is not supported. See [Unsupported chain id](#unsupported-chain-id).
* `UnsupportedChainError`: the target or the source chain is not supported. See [Unsupported chain id](#unsupported-chain-id).
* `UnsupportedTokenError`: the token you're requesting is not supported. Make sure you're only using supported tokens when setting `tokenRequests`. See [Unsupported token addresses](#unsupported-token-addresses).
* `TokenNotSupportedError`: the token you're requesting is not supported. See [Unsupported token addresses](#unsupported-token-addresses).
* `AuthenticationRequiredError`: make sure you're providing an API key when using mainnets by passing `rhinestoneApiKey` param. See [Authentication is required](#authentication-is-required).
* `InvalidApiKeyError`: the API key you're using has expired or is invalid. See [Invalid API key](#invalid-api-key).
* `InvalidIntentSignatureError`: [Invalid bundle signature](#invalid-bundle-signature).
* `OnlyOneTargetTokenAmountCanBeUnsetError`: when specifying `tokenRequests`, you need to provide the exact token amounts for all except one token.
* `NoPathFoundError`: we couldn't find a path for the intent you've provided. Try using a different set of token requests on the target chain.
* `IntentNotFoundError`: can't find the intent in the system. Please try again or use different input parameters.
* `RateLimitedError`: you're being rate-limited. Refer to the `retry-after` header and retry later.
* `ServiceUnavailableError`: temporary service outage. Safe to retry later.
* `SchemaValidationError`: request failed schema validation (400/422). Fix payload and retry.
* `BodyParserError`: request body could not be parsed (encoding/size). Fix body and retry.

## Orchestrator Errors

### `Insufficient Balance`

In most cases, getting this error means the account balance is not enough to cover the tokens required on the target chain, together with the gas costs.

Sometimes, you have enough balance, but the cost to claim it is too high (e.g., on Ethereum Mainnet).

You can also get the error if the contract is not deployed on any supported chain.

Make sure your account is deployed and funded.

Also, make sure you have enough funds for your transaction, taking gas costs into account. You can use the [spendable amount utility](./max-spendable-amount) to get an estimate of how much you can spend.

### `Unsupported chain id`

This error could mean that your `targetChain` [is not supported](../../home/introduction/supported-chains).

It could also mean that you're using testnet chains on a production environment, or mainnet chains on a dev environment.

Make sure the chain you're using matches the environment.

Also, make sure that the chain you're using is supported.

### `Unsupported token addresses`

Most likely, you will encounter this when the token that you're requesting on the target chain doesn't exist or is not supported.

Make sure the token that you request corresponds to the target execution chain.

### `Authentication is required`

Every request to the Orchestrator on mainnets requires an API key.

Make sure you provide a key. [Reach out to us](https://t.me/konradkopp) if you need one.

### `Invalid API key`

The API key you've provided when making a request is not valid.

Make sure you provide a development API key if you're working with testnets, and a production API key if you're working with mainnets. [Reach out to us](https://t.me/konradkopp) if you miss the proper key.

### `Invalid bundle signature`

The bundle signature doesn't match the account.

Make sure the bundle hash you're signing is correct.

Also, make sure the signer (or signers) of the hash is the owner of the account.
