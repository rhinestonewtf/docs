description: "Understand injected executions in Rhinestone's intent system for sophisticated cross-chain operations."

## Overview

Rhinestone may inject operations needed to complete your request, such as token approvals or routing steps. These happen automatically as part of `sendTransaction`.

## Example Code

```tsx
const intent = await rhinestoneAccount.sendTransaction({
  sourceChains: [ethereum],
  targetChain: arbitrum,
  calls: [
    {
      to: arbitrumUSDC,
      data: encodeFunctionData({
        abi: erc20Abi,
        functionName: 'transfer',
        args: [recipient, amount],
      }),
    },
  ],
  tokenRequests: [
    { address: arbitrumUSDC, amount: parseUnits('1000', 6) },
  ],
})
```

<Note>Approvals, wrapping, and other steps may be injected automatically as needed. No extra configuration is required.</Note>
