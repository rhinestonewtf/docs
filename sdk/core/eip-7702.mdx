title: "Upgrade an EOA (EIP-7702)"
---

Rhinestone SDK supports smart EOAs (EIP-7702 accounts) out of the box.

You can use any compatible account provider for batched transactions, gas sponsorship, custom validators, session keys, and chain abstraction.

<Info>Using EIP-7702 features requires `viem@2.28.0` or higher.</Info>

<Warning>Not all smart accounts are compatible with EIP-7702. We recommend starting with [Biconomy Nexus](../customize/smart-account-providers/nexus).</Warning>

To turn an EOA into a smart account:

```ts {6}
const rhinestoneAccount = await createRhinestoneAccount({
  owners: {
    type: 'ecdsa',
    accounts: [eoaAccount],
  },
  eoa: eoaAccount,
  rhinestoneApiKey,
})
```

When making the first transaction, this will delegate EOA code to the smart account and initialize it with the required modules.
