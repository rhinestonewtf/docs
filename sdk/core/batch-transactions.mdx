You can make multiple calls in a single transaction:

```ts
import { getTokenAddress } from '@rhinestone/sdk/orchestrator'
import { baseSepolia } from 'viem/chains'

const chain = baseSepolia
const usdcAddress = getTokenAddress('USDC', chain)
const usdcAmount = 1n
const ethAmount = 2n
const receiver = '0xd8da6bf26964af9d7eed9e03e53415d37aa96045'

const transaction = await rhinestoneAccount.sendTransaction({
  chain,
  calls: [
    {
      to: usdcAddress,
      data: encodeFunctionData({
        abi: erc20Abi,
        functionName: 'transfer',
        args: [receiver, usdcAmount],
      }),
    },
    {
      to: receiver,
      value: ethAmount,
    },
  ]
})
console.log('Transaction', transaction)
```
