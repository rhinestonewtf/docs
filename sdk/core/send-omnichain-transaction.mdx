To make your first cross-chain transaction, make sure that:

1) The account is deployed on [any chain](../../home/introduction/supported-chains).
2) The account has at least one of the [supported assets](../../home/introduction/supported-chains) on the chain with the deployed account.

```ts
const usdcTarget = getTokenAddress('USDC', arbitrumSepolia.id)
const usdcAmount = 1n
const receiver = '0xd8da6bf26964af9d7eed9e03e53415d37aa96045'

const transaction = await rhinestoneAccount.sendTransaction({
  sourceChains: [baseSepolia],
  targetChain: arbitrumSepolia,
  calls: [
    {
      to: usdcTarget,
      value: 0n,
      data: encodeFunctionData({
        abi: erc20Abi,
        functionName: 'transfer',
        args: [receiver, usdcAmount],
      }),
    },
  ],
  tokenRequests: [
    {
      address: usdcTarget,
      amount: usdcAmount,
    },
  ],
})
```

Assuming you have USDC on Base Sepolia, this will bridge some of that USDC to Arbitrum Sepolia and execute the transfer transaction.

If the smart account is not deployed on the target chain (i.e., Arbitrum Sepolia), it will also deploy the account code on that chain.

<Note>Make sure the token address in `calls` and `tokenRequests` corresponds to the _target_ chain.</Note>

## Granular APIs

You can also use lower-level APIs to get more control over the transaction flow.

This approach is useful when you need to:
- Separate data fetching from signing (e.g., fetch intent data on your backend API, then sign on a mobile frontend)
- Present transaction details to users before they sign
- Manually control account deployment across chains

Here's the same transaction as above made with the granular API methods:

```ts
const sourceChain = baseSepolia
const targetChain = arbitrumSepolia

const usdcTarget = getTokenAddress('USDC', targetChain.id)
const usdcAmount = 1n
const receiver = '0xd8da6bf26964af9d7eed9e03e53415d37aa96045'

// Manually trigger the account deployment
await rhinestoneAccount.deploy(sourceChain)
// Prepare the transaction by fetching the intent data
const bundleData = await rhinestoneAccount.prepareTransaction({
  sourceChain,
  targetChain,
  calls: [
    {
      to: usdcTarget as Address,
      value: 0n,
      data: encodeFunctionData({
        abi: erc20Abi,
        functionName: 'transfer',
        args: [receiver, usdcAmount],
      }),
    },
  ],
  tokenRequests: [
    {
      address: usdcTarget as Address,
      amount: usdcAmount,
    },
  ],
})
// Sign the transaction â€” this prompts the account owners to sign
const signedBundleData = await rhinestoneAccount.signTransaction(bundleData)
// Submit the transaction to the blockchain
const transaction = await rhinestoneAccount.submitTransaction(signedBundleData)
```
