description: "Sponsor gas, bridging, and swap fees for your users"

You can sponsor user fees in three ways:

1) Cover the transaction gas
2) Cover the bridging fee
3) Cover the swap fee (when using intent-based or injected swaps)

Sponsorship can be applied to all transactions or handled on a case-by-case basis.

You can sponsor both cross-chain and same-chain transactions.

<Note>You can test fee sponsorship on testnets with no additional setup. Reach out to us if you need to set this up in production.</Note>

## Usage

To sponsor a transaction:

```ts {11}
const transactionData = await rhinestoneAccount.prepareTransaction({
  sourceChains: [sourceChain],
  targetChain,
  calls: [
    {
      to: '0xd8da6bf26964af9d7eed9e03e53415d37aa96045',
      value: 0n,
      data: '0xdeadbeef',
    },
  ],
  sponsored: true,
})
```

## Sponsorship Policies

Currently, the SDK doesn't provide any policies out of the box. You can implement bespoke, flexible policies on your backend.

Here's one example, where we only sponsor transactions that interact with a specific contract:

```ts
// Sponsors a transaction only if it interacts with our app
function isSponsored(
  sourceChains: Chain[],
  targetChain: Chain,
  calls: {
    to: string
    value: bigint
    data: string
  }[],
): boolean {
  const appContractAddress = '0xbeefbeefbeefbeefbeefbeefbeefbeefbeefbeef'
  return calls.some((call) => call.to === appContractAddress)
}
```

You can then use that function when handling the user's transaction request:

```ts {12}
const calls = [
  {
    to: '0xd8da6bf26964af9d7eed9e03e53415d37aa96045' as Address,
    value: 0n,
    data: '0xdeadbeef' as Hex,
  },
]
const transactionData = await rhinestoneAccount.prepareTransaction({
  sourceChains: [sourceChain],
  targetChain,
  calls,
  sponsored: isSponsored([sourceChain], targetChain, calls),
})
```


## Sponsorship Types

Currently, there is no way to enable sponsorship types granularly. Reach out to us if you would benefit from that.
