title: "Unified Balance"

The Omni Account uses the aggregated balance of the user's funds across all supported chains, taking into account any outstanding intents.

To get the aggregated portfolio of tokens:

```ts
const portfolio = await rhinestoneAccount.getPortfolio()
```

To get the aggregated portfolio of testnet tokens:

```ts
const onTestnets = true
const portfolio = await rhinestoneAccount.getPortfolio(onTestnets)
```

This will return the list of *spendable* tokens (i.e., not part of any pending transaction).
