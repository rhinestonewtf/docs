<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Insufficient Balance">

In most cases, getting this error means the account balance is not enough to cover the tokens required on the target chain, together with the gas costs.

Sometimes, you have enough balance, but the cost to claim it is too high (e.g., on Ethereum Mainnet).

You can also get the error if the contract is not deployed on any supported chain.

Make sure your account is deployed and funded.

Also, make sure you have enough funds for your transaction, taking gas costs into account. You can use the [spendable amount utility](/smart-wallet/chain-abstraction/source-token-amount) to get an estimate of how much you can spend.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Unsupported chain id">

This error could mean that your `targetChain` [is not supported](/home/resources/supported-chains).

It could also mean that you're using testnet chains on a production environment, or mainnet chains on a dev environment.

Make sure the chain you're using matches the environment.

Also, make sure that the chain you're using is supported.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Unsupported token addresses">

Most likely, you will encounter this when the token that you're requesting on the target chain doesn't exist or is not supported.

Make sure the token that you request corresponds to the target execution chain.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Authentication is required">

Every request to the Orchestrator on mainnets requires an API key.

Make sure you provide a key. [Reach out to us](https://t.me/konradkopp) if you need one.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Invalid API key">

The API key you've provided when making a request is not valid.

Make sure you provide a development API key if you're working with testnets, and a production API key if you're working with mainnets. [Reach out to us](https://t.me/konradkopp) if you miss the proper key.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Invalid bundle signature">

The bundle signature doesn't match the account.

Make sure the bundle hash you're signing is correct.

Also, make sure the signer (or signers) of the hash is the owner of the account.
