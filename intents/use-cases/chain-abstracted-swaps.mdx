Rhinestone automatically handles the cross-chain token swaps for you.

The routing will find the best path from the user's existing balance to the requested token balance on the destination chain, whether by bridging, swapping, or both.

## Response

In the case of a swap, you will get a quote where the source (spent) token is different from the target (requested) token:

```json
{
  // …
  "intentCost": {
    // …
    "tokensReceived": [
      {
        // Receiving USDC on Optimism
        "tokenAddress": "0x0b2c639c533813f4aa9d7837caf62653d097ff85",
        "hasFulfilled": true,
        "amountSpent": "81032981",
        "destinationAmount": "81029468",
        "fee": "3513"
      }
    ],
    "tokensSpent": {
      "8453": {
        // Using WETH on Base
        "0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000006": {
          "locked": "0",
          "unlocked": "22291303013436002",
          "version": 0
        }
      },
    }
  }
}
```
