With Rhinestone, you can bridge from multiple chains and/or multiple tokens.

The API will automatically find the most optimal path, whether it's a single- or multi-input intent.

## Request

You can also influence the routing by specifying input tokens and chains via `accountAccessList`:

```json
{
  "accountAccessList": {
    "chainIds": [10, 8453],
    "tokens": ["USDC"]
  }
}
```

Learn more about choosing the inputs in the ["Getting a Quote" guide](../guides/getting-a-quote#source-chain-%2F-token).

## Response

In the case of multi-input bridging, you will get a route with multiple elements (one for each input chain) and/or multiple spent tokens.

```json Multi-Input Intent
{
  "intentOp": {
    // …
    "elements": [
      {
        "chainId": "8453",
        // …
      },
      {
        "chainId": "10",
        // …
      }
    ],
  },
  "intentCost": {
    // …
    "tokensSpent": {
      "8453": {
        "0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000006": {
          "locked": "0",
          "unlocked": "22291303013436002",
          "version": 0
        }
      },
      "10": {
        "0x0b2c639c533813f4aa9d7837caf62653d097ff85": {
          "locked": "0",
          "unlocked": "8370380",
          "version": 0
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

If the user doesn't have outstanding Permit2 approvals, they will need to approve multiple input tokens.

The user will also need to sign each element separately, i.e., one signature per input chain.
