description: "Submit the signed operations to the Orchestrator"

Once you've [signed](./signing) the intent operations, you can submit it to the Orchestrator to execute it.

We will use the `/intent-operations` endpoint:

```ts Submit Intent
const baseUrl = "https://v1.orchestrator.rhinestone.dev";
const endpoint = `${baseUrl}/intent-operations`;
const apiKey = "YOUR_RHINESTONE_API_KEY";

const payload = {
  intentOp,
  originSignatures,
  destinationSignature
};

const res = await fetch(endpoint, {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "x-api-key": apiKey,
    Accept: "application/json",
  },
  body: JSON.stringify(payload, (_, value) =>
    typeof value === "bigint" ? value.toString() : value,
  ),
});

if (!res.ok) {
  const errorBody = await res.text().catch(() => "");
  throw new Error(
    `Request failed: ${res.status} ${res.statusText}${errorBody ? ` - ${errorBody}` : ""}`
  );
}

const data = await res.json();
console.log("Result:", data);
```

### Polling for Status

When submitting an intent operation, you get the operation id back.

You can use this ID to track the status of the intent execution.

Using the `/intent-operation/:id` endpoint:

```ts Get Status
const baseUrl = "https://v1.orchestrator.rhinestone.dev";
const operationId = "OPERATION_ID";
const endpoint = `${baseUrl}/intent-operation/${operationId}`;
const apiKey = "YOUR_RHINESTONE_API_KEY";

const res = await fetch(endpoint, {
  method: "GET",
  headers: {
    "x-api-key": apiKey,
    Accept: "application/json",
  },
});

if (!res.ok) {
  const errorBody = await res.text().catch(() => "");
  throw new Error(
    `Request failed: ${res.status} ${res.statusText}${errorBody ? ` - ${errorBody}` : ""}`
  );
}

const data = await res.json();
console.log("Status:", data);
```

The intent operations can have the following status:

* `PENDING` — in progress
* `CLAIMED` — the source funds were claimed by the solver, but the intent is not yet executed on the destination chain
* `COMPLETED` — fully completed and executed onchain
* `PRECONFIRMED` — confirmed by solver, but not yet executed onchain
* `FILLED` — executed on the destination chain, but the funds are not yet claimed on the source chain(s)
* `EXPIRED` — missed the execution deadline
* `FAILED` — failed to execute
