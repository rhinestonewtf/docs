As part of the [quote](./getting-a-quote), you'll usually get a list of token requirements. Those requirements can span across multiple chains and tokens.

There are two types of requirements:
* ERC-20 token approvals: used to pre-approve the tokens to the Permit2 contract
* ETH wrapping: used to wrap the ether into WETH, to be compatible with the Permit2 contract

Here's an example of token requirements:

```json
{
  "8453": {
    "0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000006": {
      "type": "approval",
      "amount": "102656447694688542",
      "spender": "0x000000000022d473030f116ddee9f6b43ac78ba3"
    },
    "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000": {
      "type": "wrap",
      "amount": "102656447694688542"
    }
  }
}
```

In this example:
1) ETH needs to be wrapped on Base
2) WETH (wrapped in the first step) needs to be approved to the [Permit2](https://github.com/Uniswap/permit2) contract on Base

## ERC-20 Approvals

<CodeGroup dropdown>
```ts Approve a token
import {
  switchChain,
  writeContract,
} from "@wagmi/core";
import {
  maxUint256,
} from "viem";

await switchChain(wagmiConfig, { chainId: chain.id });

const hash = await writeContract(wagmiConfig, {
  address,
  abi: [
    {
      name: "approve",
      type: "function",
      stateMutability: "nonpayable",
      inputs: [
        { name: "spender", type: "address" },
        { name: "amount", type: "uint256" },
      ],
      outputs: [{ name: "", type: "bool" }],
    },
  ],
  functionName: "approve",
  args: [requirement.spender, maxUint256],
});
```
</CodeGroup>

<Info>
While it's possible to approve the exact amount of tokens, we suggest doing infinite approvals to Permit2 contract to streamline the future UX.

## ETH Wrapping

<CodeGroup dropdown>
```ts Wrap ETH
import {
  switchChain,
  writeContract,
} from "@wagmi/core";
import {
  maxUint256,
} from "viem";

await switchChain(wagmiConfig, { chainId: chain.id });

const hash = await writeContract(wagmiConfig, {
  address,
  abi: [
    {
      name: "deposit",
      type: "function",
      stateMutability: "payable",
      inputs: [],
      outputs: [],
    },
  ],
  functionName: "deposit",
  value: requirement.amount,
});
```
</CodeGroup>

Once you've fulfilled all the necessary requirements, you can move on to signing the intent.
