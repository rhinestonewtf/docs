Warp API offers the transaction execution services for EOAs and smart accounts.

It utilises [intents](../../home/introduction/rhinestone-intents) to execute same-chain and cross-chain transactions.

You will need [an API key](https://tally.so/r/wg22x4) to get started. Note that using testnets doesn't require you to provide an API key.
