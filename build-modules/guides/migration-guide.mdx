## 0.5.0

This migration guide assumes you have already migrated to `^0.4.0` and are now migrating to `^0.5.0`.

### Integrated `module-bases`

The [module-bases](https://github.com/rhinestonewtf/module-bases) repository has been integrated within ModuleKit and is no longer required as a dependency. You should:

1. Remove the module-bases dependency if using modulekit and module-bases in the same project
2. Update imports to reference module-bases from `src/module-bases`

```diff
- import { ERC7579ValidatorBase } from "module-bases/ERC7579ValidatorBase.sol"
+ import { ERC7579ValidatorBase } from "modulekit/module-bases/ERC7579ValidatorBase.sol"
```

### Deprecated Account Dependencies

Dependencies to the following smart account repositories have been removed:

- [safe7579](https://github.com/rhinestonewtf/safe7579)
- [erc7579 reference implementation](https://github.com/erc7579/erc7579-implementation)
- [kernel](https://github.com/zerodevapp/kernel)

All required interfaces and libraries are now located within `src/accounts/` where each account has a specific folder with its own implementations.

Example updating imports:

```diff
- import { ISafe7579 } from "safe7579/ISafe7579.sol"
+ import { ISafe7579 } from "modulekit/accounts/safe/interfaces/ISafe7579.sol"
```

### Deprecated `src/external/ERC7579.sol`

All contracts imported from the ERC7579 reference implementation have been removed. Interfaces and libraries have been moved to:

- ERC7579 interfaces -> `src/accounts/erc7579/interfaces`
- ERC7579 libraries -> `src/accounts/erc7579/lib`

### Changed `src/Accounts.sol`

`Accounts.sol` no longer imports `Execution` from `external/ERC7579.sol`. It now imports all smart account interfaces directly:

```diff
- import { Execution } from "modulekit/external/ERC7579.sol"
+ import { Execution } from "modulekit/accounts/common/interfaces/IERC7579Account.sol"
```

Major interfaces now imported:

- `IERC7579Account` (common ERC7579 interface)
- `IMSA` (ERC7579 reference implementation)
- `IKernelAccount` (Kernel)
- `ISafe7579` (Safe7579)

### Deprecated `src/Core.sol`

`Core.sol` is unused and has been removed.

### Changed `src/Helpers.sol`

`sign` is no longer imported within `Helpers.sol`. It has been moved to `src/test/utils/ECDSA.sol`. All account helpers are now consolidated in `Helpers.sol`

```diff
- import { sign } from "./external/Vm.sol"
+ import { ecdsaSign } from "./test/utils/ECDSA.sol"
```

### Changed `src/Interface.sol`, `src/Mocks.sol`, `src/Modules.sol`

Since module-bases is now integrated, the imports in these files come from local files:

- `src/Interfaces.sol`
- `src/Mocks.sol`
- `src/Modules.sol`

If you are using module-bases as an external dependency in conjunction with ModuleKit, this could cause compiler issues. We recommend removing the module-bases dependency and only using ModuleKit.
