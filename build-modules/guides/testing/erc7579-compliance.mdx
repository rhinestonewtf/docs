The ModuleKit has some helpers to automatically test for ERC-7579 compliance. Currently, we have the following checks:

- Ensure that module storage is cleared when a module is uninstalled


## Uninstall the module at the end of every test

When you write your tests, ensure that you call uninstall on the module at the end of each test.

```solidity
instance.uninstallModule({ moduleTypeId: MODULE_TYPE_VALIDATOR, module: module, data: "" });
```

## Use the `withModuleStorageClearValidation` modifier

To do this, add the modifier to all the tests.

```solidity
function test_foo() public withModuleStorageClearValidation(instance, module) {...}
```

## Run your tests with the `COMPLIANCE=true` flag

To run the tests with the compliance flag, run:

```bash
COMPLIANCE=true forge test
```

Note: running the compliance tests at the same time as the simulation tests can lead to issues so it is discouraged.

If your tests are successful, you are compliant with the ERC-7579 rules. Otherwise, your tests will revert.
