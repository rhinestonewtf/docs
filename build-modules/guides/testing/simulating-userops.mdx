sidebarTitle: "Simulating UserOps"

The ModuleKit is integrated with the [ERC-4337 Validation library](../../erc4337-validation/overview) in order to make it effortless to ensure modules comply with the restrictions required by the ERC-4337 mempool. You can find the restrictions in the [ERC-7562 specifications](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7562). Note: alternatively to the below, you can also use the [`simulateUserOp`](../../reference/testing/utilities/simulateUserOp) function to simulate only specific UserOperations.

## Update your configuration

To use simulation, you will need to update your `foundry.toml` file as follows:

```bash
gas_limit = "18446744073709551615"
memory_limit = 2147483648
verbosity = 3
```

## Write your tests

When you write your tests, you can use the `makeAccountInstance` function to create an account instance. Then, you can use this `instance` to execute transactions, for example:

```solidity
// Create an account instance
AccountInstance memory instance = makeAccountInstance("account1");

// Execute a UserOperation on the account
instance.exec({ target: address(1), value: 1 wei, callData: "" });
```

## Run your tests with simulation

To do this, run:

```bash
SIMULATE=true forge test
```

If your tests are successful, you are compliant with the ERC-4337 restrictions. Otherwise, you will receive an error message.
