title: "deployModule"

Deploy the module via the Registry and register it.

## Usage

```solidity
bytes32 salt = keccak256(abi.encodePacked("SALT"));
ResolverUID resolverUID = ResolverUID.wrap(...);
bytes memory initCode = abi.encodePacked(type(Module).creationCode);
bytes memory metadata = "";
bytes memory resolverContext = "";

address moduleAddress = registry.deployModule(salt, resolverUID, initCode, metadata, resolverContext);
```

## Parameters

### salt

- Type: `bytes32`

The salt value to use for the module deployment. Note that the first 20 bytes should be either the `msg.sender` for replay protection or zeroed out.

### resolverUID

- Type: `ResolverUID | bytes32`

The resolver UID to use for the module deployment. You can find the default resolver UID in the [address book](../../../home/resources/address-book).

### initCode

- Type: `bytes`

The initialization code for the module deployment.

### metadata

- Type: `bytes`

Additional metadata to store on the Registry. This can be left empty.

### resolverContext

- Type: `bytes`

Additional context to pass to the resolver. This can be left empty.

## Returns

### moduleAddress

- Type: `address`
