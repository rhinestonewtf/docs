title: "expect4337Revert"

Expect a UserOperation to revert. Similar to Foundry's `vm.expectRevert` function but the latter will not work with UserOperations.

## Usage

```solidity
instance.expect4337Revert();
```

## Parameters

### instance

- Type: [`AccountInstance`](../../glossary/types#accountinstance)

The instance of the account used for testing.

### selector (optional)

- Type: `bytes4`

The selector of the revert reason. If not provided, any revert reason will be accepted.

### message (optional)

- Type: `bytes`

The entire revert reason. If not provided, any revert reason will be accepted.

## Returns

The function will revert if the UserOperation does not revert.
