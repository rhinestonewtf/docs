title: "Account Deployments"

The Rhinestone SDK handles the account deployments for you.

On the target chain, the deployments are handled by the orchestrator in most cases.

On the source chains, you can either use an ERC-4337 bundler or a separate _deployer_ EOA to deploy.

## Using a bundler

By default, accounts are deployed with an ERC-4337 bundler. This requires the account to be prefunded on the source chains with ETH to pay for gas.

See [ERC-4337 Infra](../customize/erc4337-infra) for more details on using bundlers.

```ts {6-9}
const rhinestoneAccount = await createRhinestoneAccount({
  owners: {
    type: 'ecdsa',
    accounts: [account],
  }
  bundler: {
    type: 'pimlico',
    apiKey: pimlicoApiKey,
  },
})
```

<Warning>While the bundler configuration is not required to get started, it is highly recommended to provide the API key for production use.</Warning>

## Using a deployer EOA

Alternatively, you can use a separate EOA to deploy a smart account. This lets you sponsor the gas to cover the deployment cost in ETH.

```ts {6}
const rhinestoneAccount = await createRhinestoneAccount({
  owners: {
    type: 'ecdsa',
    accounts: [account],
  }
  deployer: deployerAccount,
})
```

<Note>Make sure the deployer EOA has enough ETH on the _source_ chain to cover deployment costs.</Note>
