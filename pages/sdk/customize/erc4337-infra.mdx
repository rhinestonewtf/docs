title: "ERC-4337 Infra"
---

Internally, the SDK uses ERC-4337 bundlers to deploy and to submit transaction through the UserOp (e.g. when using smart sessions).

Supplying the API key is optional, but highly recommended for production use.

## Pimlico

To use [Pimlico](https://www.pimlico.io/), provide an API key during account initialization:

```ts {7-10}
const rhinestoneAccount = await createRhinestoneAccount({
  owners: {
    type: 'ecdsa',
    accounts: [account],
  }
  rhinestoneApiKey,
  bundler: {
    type: 'pimlico',
    apiKey: pimlicoApiKey,
  },
})
```
