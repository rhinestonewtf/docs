Rhinestone SDK supports smart EOAs (EIP-7702) out of the box.

You can use any compatible account provider for batched transactions, gas sponsorship, custom validators, session keys, and chain abstraction.

<Warning>Not all smart accounts are compatible with EIP-7702. We recommend starting with [Biconomy Nexus](../customize/smart-account-providers/biconomy-nexus).</Warning>

To turn an EOA into a smart account:

```ts {6}
const rhinestoneAccount = await createRhinestoneAccount({
  owners: {
    type: 'ecdsa',
    accounts: [eoaAccount],
  }
  eoa: [eoaAccount],
  rhinestoneApiKey,
})
```

When making the first transaction, this will delegate EOA code to the smart account and initilize it with the required modules.
