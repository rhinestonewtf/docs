To create a passkey-owned account:

```ts {3-5,8-11}
import { toWebAuthnAccount } from 'viem/account-abstraction'

const passkeyAccount = toWebAuthnAccount({
  credential,
})

const rhinestoneAccount = await createRhinestoneAccount({
  owners: {
    type: 'passkey',
    account: passkeyAccount,
  }
  rhinestoneApiKey,
})
```

<Note>We're working on a multisig support for passkeys. Let us know if you would benefit from that.</Note>
