## Single Owner

To create an account owned by a single EOA:

```ts
const rhinestoneAccount = await createRhinestoneAccount({
  owners: {
    type: 'ecdsa',
    accounts: [account],
  }
  rhinestoneApiKey,
})
```

## Multisig

To create a multisig account:

```ts {4}
const rhinestoneAccount = await createRhinestoneAccount({
  owners: {
    type: 'ecdsa',
    accounts: [accountA, accountB, accountC],
  }
  rhinestoneApiKey,
})
```


You can also specify the signature threshold (i.e., how many signatures are required to authorize the transaction):

```ts {5}
const rhinestoneAccount = await createRhinestoneAccount({
  owners: {
    type: 'ecdsa',
    accounts: [accountA, accountB, accountC],
    threshold: 2,
  }
  rhinestoneApiKey,
})
```

By default, the `threshold` is 1 (any multisig owner can sign any transaction).
