To make your first cross-chain transaction, make sure that:

1) The account is deployed on [any chain](../../overview/introduction/supported-chains).
2) The account has at least one of the [supported assets](../../overview/introduction/supported-chains) on the chain with the deployed account.

```ts
const usdcTarget = getTokenAddress('USDC', arbitrumSepolia.id)
const usdcAmount = 1n
const receiver = '0xd8da6bf26964af9d7eed9e03e53415d37aa96045'

const transaction = await rhinestoneAccount.sendTransaction({
  sourceChain: baseSepolia,
  targetChain: arbitrumSepolia,
  calls: [
    {
      to: usdcTarget,
      value: 0n,
      data: encodeFunctionData({
        abi: erc20Abi,
        functionName: 'transfer',
        args: [receiver, usdcAmount],
      }),
    },
  ],
  tokenRequests: [
    {
      address: usdcTarget,
      amount: usdcAmount,
    },
  ],
})
```

Assuming you had USDC on Base Sepolia, this will bridge some of that USDC to Arbitrum Sepolia and execute the transfer transaction.

If the smart account is not deployed on the target chain (i.e., Arbitrum Sepolia), it will also deploy the account code on that chain.
