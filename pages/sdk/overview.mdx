The Rhinestone SDK makes it easy to build with chain-abstracted Smart Accounts. It is a TypeScript library built on Viem that provides a unified interface to simplify interactions with [supported Smart Account implementations](../overview/concepts/smart-accounts), feature customization with [Modules](./core-setup/core-modules), and [Chain Abstraction](./core-setup/create-omni-account).

## Features

* **Account-agnostic**: works with any ERC-7579 compatible account
* **Intents**: creates and submits token intents
* **Chain Abstraction**: supports M-to-1 chains to destination chain and M-to-n input tokens to output tokens
* **Module Customization**: custom signers (e.g., passkeys), smart sessions, and social recovery
* **Gas Sponsorship**: cover gas costs for your users (Coming soon)  
* **Viem compatible**: familiar design and ergonomic APIs
