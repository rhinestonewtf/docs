## Single Owner

To make an EOA account the session owner:

```ts {2-5}
const session: Session = {
  owners: {
    type: 'ecdsa',
    accounts: [sessionOwnerAccount],
  },
  policies: [
    {
      type: 'sudo',
    },
  ],
}
```

## Multisig

To create a multisig session:

```ts {4}
const session: Session = {
  owners: {
    type: 'ecdsa',
    accounts: [accountA, accountB, accountC],
  },
  policies: [
    {
      type: 'sudo',
    },
  ],
}
```

You can also specify the signature threshold (i.e., how many signatures are required to authorize the transaction):

```ts {5}
const session: Session = {
  owners: {
    type: 'ecdsa',
    accounts: [accountA, accountB, accountC],
    threshold: 2,
  },
  policies: [
    {
      type: 'sudo',
    },
  ],
}
```

By default, the `threshold` is 1 (any session owner account can authorize any transaction within the session).
