[Smart Sessions](https://github.com/erc7579/smartsessions) is an implementation of session keys that works across all ERC-7579-compatible accounts.

It separates **validators**, **policies**, and **actions** to increase composability and component reuse, which improves developer efficiency and costs.

## Owners

Smart Sessions support a wide range of signing mechanisms out of the box:

- [Single ECDSA key](./signature-validators/ecdsa)
- [Multiple ECDSA keys](./signature-validators/ecdsa) (i.e. multisig)
- Passkeys (_soon_)

You can also use custom validators to validate sessions, as long as they are ERC-1271 compatible.

## Actions

Actions define what transactions (calls) you can make within a session. An action is defined by the _target address_ and the _function selector_.

An example of an action would be token transfer, where `target` would be the address of the ERC20 token and `selector` would be `0xa9059cbb` (the transfer function selector).

When defining multiple actions within a session, a transaction that matches **any** specified action is considered valid. If no actions are specified, **any** transaction will pass.

## Policies

Policies let you restrict the session to hit specific conditions. You can define policies at the _session_ (affects the entire session) or _action_ (affects a single action within a session) level.

Supported policies include:

- [Sudo](./policies/sudo): allows any action
- Universal action: allows actions with the specified calldata
- Spending limit: allows a limited value of ERC20 tokens to be transferred and approved
- Timeframe: allows actions within the specified time frame
- Usage limit: allows a limited number of actions
- Value limit: allows a limited ETH value transfered

When defining multiple policies within a session or an action, a transaction that passes **every** specified policy is considered valid. If no policies are specified, **any** transaction will pass (i.e., the sudo policy is applied).

## Creating sessions

To create an account with a session key:

```ts {1-6,13}
const session: Session = {
  owners: {
    type: 'ecdsa',
    accounts: [sessionOwnerAccount],
  },
}

const rhinestoneAccount = await createRhinestoneAccount({
  owners: {
    type: 'ecdsa',
    accounts: [ownerAccount],
  },
  sessions: [session],
  rhinestoneApiKey,
})
```

You can also limit the session to specific allowed actions:

```ts {6-16}
const session: Session = {
  owners: {
    type: 'ecdsa',
    accounts: [sessionOwnerAccount],
  },
  actions: [
    {
      target: usdcAddress,
      selector: toFunctionSelector(
        getAbiItem({
          abi: erc20Abi,
          name: 'transfer',
        }),
      ),
    },
  ],
}
```

Finally, you can specify policies at both session and action levels:

```ts {6-10,20-31}
const session: Session = {
  owners: {
    type: 'ecdsa',
    accounts: [sessionOwnerAccount],
  },
  policies: [
    {
      type: 'sudo',
    },
  ],
  actions: [
    {
      target: usdcAddress,
      selector: toFunctionSelector(
        getAbiItem({
          abi: erc20Abi,
          name: 'transfer',
        }),
      ),
      policies: [
        {
          type: 'universal-action',
          rules: [
            {
              condition: 'equal',
              calldataOffset: 0n,
              referenceValue: '0xd8da6bf26964af9d7eed9e03e53415d37aa96045',
            },
          ],
        },
      ],
    },
  ],
}
```

## Using sessions

To authorize a transaction with a session key you've defined before:

```ts {13-16}
const transactionResult = await rhinestoneAccount.sendTransaction({
  chain,
  calls: [
    {
      to: usdcAddress,
      data: encodeFunctionData({
        abi: erc20Abi,
        functionName: 'transfer',
        args: ['0xd8da6bf26964af9d7eed9e03e53415d37aa96045', 1n],
      }),
    },
  ],
  signers: {
    type: 'session',
    session: session,
  },
})
```

This will prompt the signature request from the session owner(s) and submit the transaction on their behalf.
