title: "Usage Limit Policy"
---

You can limit the number of times the session can be used.

To enable the policy:

```ts {6-11}
const session: Session = {
  owners: {
    type: "ecdsa",
    accounts: [accountA],
  },
  policies: [
    {
      type: "usage-limit",
      limit: 10n,
    },
  ],
};
```

This will create a session that can only be used 10 times.
