title: "Call Policy"
---

Call policy allows to filter out transaction based on the calldata and ether value.

Within a policy, you can set up to 16 rules. Each rule consists of a condition, the calldata offset, and a reference value to compare.

When chechking a transaction, the policy checks it against every rule. For a policy to accept a transaction, *every* rule of that policy should pass.

## Conditions

Available conditions are:

* equal (x == A)
* greater than (x > A)
* less than (x < A)
* greater than or equal (x ≥ A)
* less than or equal (x ≤ A)
* not equal (x ≠ A)
* in range (A ≤ x ≤ B)

## Calldata Offset

The number of bytes to offset from the start (excluding the function selector).

The compared value is a hex string of 32 bytes.

In other words, if the `offset` is 10, the compared value will be formed from the calldata with the starting index of `4 + 10 = 14` and an end index of `4 + 10 + 32 = 46`.

## Reference Value

Value to compare the calldata against to.

The reference value is a hex string of 32 bytes. For convenience, you can pass the hex string of a smaller length or a bigint, and the SDK will convert it for you.

## Usage

To enable a call policy:

```ts {8-19}
const receiver = '0xd8da6bf26964af9d7eed9e03e53415d37aa96045'

const session: Session = {
  owners: {
    type: 'ecdsa',
    accounts: [sessionOwnerAccount],
  },
  policies: [
    {
      type: 'universal-action',
      rules: [
        {
          condition: 'equal',
          calldataOffset: 0n,
          referenceValue: receiver,
        },
      ],
    },
  ],
  // ERC20 transfer action
  action: [
    target: usdcAddress,
    selector: toFunctionSelector(
      getAbiItem({
        abi: erc20,
        name: 'transfer',
      }),
    ),
  ]
}
```

Together with an ERC20 transfer action, this policy will only let USDC transfers to a single receiver address.

### Param Accumulator

You can limit the total accumulated value of a param across all session uses.

This can be helpful if you want to e.g. 

```ts
const receiver = '0xd8da6bf26964af9d7eed9e03e53415d37aa96045'

const session: Session = {
  owners: {
    type: 'ecdsa',
    accounts: [sessionOwnerAccount],
  },
  policies: [
    {
      type: 'universal-action',
      rules: [
        {
          condition: 'equal',
          calldataOffset: 0n,
          referenceValue: receiver,
          usageLimit: 
        },
      ],
    },
  ],
  // ERC20 transfer action
  action: [
    // …
  ]
}
```

### Value Limit

To limit maximum value to pass in a single transaction:

```ts {11}
const receiver = '0xd8da6bf26964af9d7eed9e03e53415d37aa96045'

const session: Session = {
  owners: {
    type: 'ecdsa',
    accounts: [sessionOwnerAccount],
  },
  policies: [
    {
      type: 'universal-action',
      valueLimitPerUse: 0n,
      rules: [
        {
          condition: 'equal',
          calldataOffset: 0n,
          referenceValue: receiver,
        },
      ],
    },
  ],
  // ERC20 transfer action
  action: [
    // …
  ]
}
```
