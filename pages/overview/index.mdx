Rhinestone is a programmable and open platform for chain-abstracted Smart Accounts. [ERC-7579](https://erc7579.com/), the leading shared standard for Modular Smart Accounts, underpins our infrastructure and tooling, making it the only account vendor-agnostic smart wallet platform. ERC-7579 is now supported by all significant Smart Accounts, including Safe, Biconomy Nexus, ZeroDev Kernel, Magicâ€™s Newton, Thirdweb, Trust Wallet, OKX, and many more. With [EIP-7702](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7702) around the corner (via [Pectra](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7600)) EOAs will soon be welcomed to the Rhinestone platform.

Build with Rhinestone to maximize distribution, ensure broader ecosystem interoperability, and significantly enhance your product UX with the [deepest library](/module-sdk) of Smart Account features ([Modules](/overview/modules)) and native intent-based chain abstraction.
