title: "Smart Accounts"
---

There are two types of accounts in the Ethereum ecosystem: externally owned accounts (EOAs) and smart accounts. Most wallets today use EOAs under the hood â€“ e.g., MetaMask and Phantom Wallet. Smart accounts are smart contracts that can transact on behalf of the user. Smart accounts are programmable, allowing developers to modify and add custom logic for authentication and execution through modules. Modules should be thought of as smart account features, and they are the core ingredient to unlocking UX- and security-enhancing properties without compromising on self-custody.

Rhinestone led the development of [ERC-7579](https://erc7579.com/), a minimal standard for modular smart accounts. This standard has been widely adopted by all major account vendors, including Safe, Biconomy, Thirdweb, Open Zeppelin, OKX, Trust Wallet, and ZeroDev.
