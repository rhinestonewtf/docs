The Omni Account system has integrated the Across Protocol as the first Settlement Layer. The Omni Account intent data structure mirrors Across, making it dead easy for Across Relayers to integrate. For more on why we choose Across, visit the [Settlement Layer section](/omni-account/architecture/settlement-layer).

## Side-by-Side the “Chain Abstraction Stack”

Omni Account sits squarely in the permission layer of the Chain Abstraction Stack, allowing users to express intents, orchestrating resource locks, and permissioning solvers to execute these intents. The Across ecosystem currently covers the solver, clearing, and settlement layers. Across Relayers listen to our [Meta Intents](/omni-account/meta-intents), fill, settle, and rebalance via the [Across Settlement Layer](/omni-account/architecture/settlement-layer).

## High-level Across Flow Diagram

1. The user interacts with an onchain app, which sends a [Meta Intent](/omni-account/meta-intents) to the Orchestrator
2. The Orchestrator propagates the Meta Intent to a solver network (Across Relayers)
3. The winning Relayer (X) fills the Meta Intent via the Across (Destination) Spokepool
4. Destination Spokepool sends funds and (optionally) makes an execution via the Omni Account on the destination chain

At this point, the user experience ends, yet funds have not been withdrawn from the origin chain Omni Account. The **second half of the flow is the claim event:**

5. Relayer triggers the claim event on the origin chain Omni Account
6. Omni Account releases funds to the Across (Origin) Spokepool
7. Across settles with the Relayer after matching the origin chain deposit event with the correct destination chain prefill event.
