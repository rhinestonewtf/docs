## Get Started

Choose your path to learning how to build with Rhinestone.

### Build on Smart Accounts

Embed smart wallets into your application or upgrade an EOA (via EIP-7702) through our simple SDK. Create seamless user onboarding flows, abstract away gas, and enable onchain policies for self-custodial transaction automation.

Start with our Quickstart guide and progress through the SDK to learn how to build onchain applications with web2-like UX, powered by smart accounts.

### Access Crosschain Liquidity

Rhinestone’s transaction infrastructure is powered by intents. Whether your users are transacting on a single chain or across multiple chains, you only need to integrate one API. Our intent system aggregates settlement layers through a unified relayer market that manages token liquidity across all supported chains. This enables optimal routing for the best crosschain speeds at the lowest price.
