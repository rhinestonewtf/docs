**Rhinestone is a vertically integrated smart wallet and crosschain liquidity platform**. 

We provide a unified SDK and API for deploying, customising, and managing self-custodial smart wallets. These smart wallets are powered by an intent-based transaction infrastructure that enables users to seamlessly transact on any supported chain, without bridging and without the need for gas tokens.

## Get Started

Choose your path to learning how to build with Rhinestone.

### Build on Smart Accounts

Embed smart wallets into your application or upgrade an EOA (via EIP-7702) through the Rhinestone SDK. Create seamless user onboarding flows, abstract away gas, and enable onchain permissions for self-custodial transaction automation.

Start with our Quickstart guide and progress through the SDK to learn how to build onchain applications with web2-like UX, powered by smart accounts.

### Crosschain Liquidity and Intents

Intents power Rhinestone’s transaction infrastructure. Whether your users are transacting on a single chain or across multiple chains, you only need to integrate one API. Rhinestone's intent system aggregates settlement layers through a unified relayer market that manages token liquidity across all supported chains. This enables optimal routing for the best crosschain speeds at the lowest price.
