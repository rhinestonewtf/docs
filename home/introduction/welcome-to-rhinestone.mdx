**Rhinestone is the simplest way to build powerful self-custodial Web3 applications.** We remove the complexities of smart accounts and chains (via chain abstraction) so that you can focus on what matters to your users.

Rhinestone is a smart account platform powered by intents. We provide infrastructure and tooling to build on any compatible smart account, extend the account’s features with modules, or perform near-instant crosschain intents. 

Rhinestone is the ideal tech stack for **developers** to build web3 apps with seamless UX.

## Get Started

Choose your path to learning how to build on chain-abstracted smart accounts with Rhinestone.

### Build on Smart Accounts

Embed smart accounts into your wallet/application or upgrade an EOA (via EIP-7702) through our simple SDK. Enable simple user onboarding, abstract away gas for your users, and enable permissions via Smart Sessions to deliver one-click experiences or self-custodial automations. 

Start with our Quickstart guide and progress through the SDK to learn how to enable an omnichain smart account application.

### Integrate Chain Abstraction

Rhinestone’s transaction infrastructure is powered by intents. Whether your users are transacting on the same chain or crosschain, you only need to integrate one API and make one simple request - we call these transactions "omnichain transactions".

### Build Modules

Rhinestone wrote the standard for modular smart accounts: [ERC-7579](erc7579.com), a minimal standard for modular smart accounts. This is the foundation for Rhinestone’s account model. The major benefit of modularity is composability and extensibility. 

If you’re looking to customize your account beyond our core features, check out ModuleKit and our extensive library of modules.
