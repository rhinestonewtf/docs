Rhinestone combines smart wallet infrastructure with an intent-based transaction system to offer the ultimate abstraction layer for teams building muilti-chain applications.

## Tech Stack Visualization

[Insert Graphic]

Rhinestone offers three core services: 
- Modular **Smart Account** toolkit, compatible with all major key management solutions
- An **Intent Engine** for single- and multi-chain transaction and swap routing
- A **Relayer Market** that aggregates solver liquidity for intent execution

## Smart Accounts

Rhinestone develops the onchain infrastructure for smart wallets, including the smart account and modules that extend the wallet with specific features. Rhinestone’s core modules include:

- **Passkeys** for secure and user-friendly self-custodial key management 
- **Session keys** for transaction automation
- **Multi-sig** for high value accounts
- **Social login** (through an embedded wallet integration)
- **Recovery** for a heightened recurity

Use these onchain components via the Rhinestone SDK to deploy, configure, and manage smart accounts for your users.

## Intent Engine

Rhinestone provides a modular intent engine that aggregates existing crosschain settlement layers through a unified relayer market. This system is called Warp. It utilizes resource locks for blazing fast crosschain execution and a sophisticated offchain solver for routing, transaction encoding, and orchestration.

Key Features:
- **Crosschain transactions**: Eliminate chains and bridges to make a multi-chain experience feel like a single chain.
- **Swaps**: Use Rhinestone’s relayers for solver-based swaps with zero-slippage and MEV protection or inject a swap via a DEX aggregator.  
- **Universal gas sponsorship**: Deposit USDC on your developer account on Base and sponsor gas, bridging, and swap fees on any chain. 
- **Multi-input intents**: Rhinestone intents can include any number of input chains and input tokens, whilst maintaining the signal-signature UX. 
- **Atomic and deterministic**: Unlike bridges, Rhinestone intents are atomic and have a known output token with zero slippage (deterministic).
- **Human-readable signatures**: An EIP-712 signature envelope guarantees a legible payload to be signed by the user, no matter the complexity of the intent.

## Relayer Market

We aggregate settlement layers (such as Across, Relay, and Eco) through a unified intent layer. This allows application developers to integrate smart wallet features and aggregate multiple settlement layers out of the box with one unified SDK and API.

## Rhinestone is Composable

Rhinestone’s modular tech stack allows us to meet clients where they are:
- **Compatible with all signers**: Use passkeys, any external wallet, or embedded wallet (such as Turnkey, Dynamic, Magic, Privy, etc) to sign intents.
- **Account Implementation-agnostic**: Rhinestone works with all major smart account implementations that follow the ERC-7579 spec or utilise ERC-7821 for batched execution.
- **Modular Smart Account**: Customize your smart wallet with modules or build custom components to extend the wallet functionality. 
- **Quote API Only**: Our intent routes can be consumed via the quote API for crosschain intents and swap quotes - without the integration of Rhinestone smart wallets.
