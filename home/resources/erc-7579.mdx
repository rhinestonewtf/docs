title: "ERC-7579"
---

ERC-7579 outlines the minimally required interfaces and behavior for modular smart accounts and modules to ensure interoperability across implementations. The standard is designed to allow account builders to continue to innovate and compete on the account level, while also enabling third-party developers to build modules that can be used seamlessly across different accounts.

Our approach to the standard is the following:

- Take learnings from existing smart accounts that have been used in production and from building interoperability layers between them
- Ensure that the interfaces are as minimal and open to alternative architectures as possible

The standard is co-authored by ZeroDev, Biconomy, Rhinestone and OKX and is currently being rolled out across the ecosystem.
