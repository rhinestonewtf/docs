Rhinestone’s core onchain infrastructure and SDKs are **open source and free**.

The transaction infrastructure has no API fee. The stakeholders in the transaction supply chain only make money once your users are transacting. These fees are transaction fees on the principal value of a crosschain transaction. 

**Same chain intents are free**. 

Solvers are incentivised to fill these transactions for two reasons:

- The solver takes a small premium on gas (see below).

- After performing same-chain intents, the solver's capital is not locked in a settlement layer. It is instantly returned to the solver on the same chain. Therefore, there is no loss in capital efficiency from filling same-chain intents.

**Crosschain fees**

Transaction fees are only charged on crosschain transfers and are currently set to 3bps for all supported chains during our private beta. 

**Gas Fees**

Gas fees are a fixed unit cost that depends on the source chain and target chain executions required to perform the intent.

The client supplies gas units. SDK helpers for the estimation are coming soon.
