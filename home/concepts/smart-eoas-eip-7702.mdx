**All of Rhinestone’s offerings are compatible with EIP-7702.** Any developer who has an existing set of EOA users can utilize all Rhinestone products, such as Smart Sessions and Chain Abstraction, without migrating their users to a new wallet.

## Overview of EIP-7702

EIP-7702, implemented in Ethereum’s Pectra hardfork in May 2025, introduces a new transaction type (Type 4\) that enables Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs) to delegate execution to smart contracts. This allows EOAs to gain smart account functionality, such as programmable transaction logic, without requiring a new wallet address. By signing an authorization, an EOA can temporarily delegate its execution to a smart account, preserving the user’s existing address while enabling advanced features.

This allows developers who already have EOA users to seamlessly offer new advanced features, such as Passkeys, Smart Sessions, and Chain Abstraction, without having to migrate their funds into a separate account.. 

## Rhinestone Offers Transaction Infrastructure for Smart EOAs

Like smart accounts, smart EOAs require transaction infrastructure—a mechanism that enables an EOA to initiate a transaction and fund the gas. This may seem surprising, given that the user already has an EOA, but the beauty of smart EOAs is that they enable new forms of signature validation, such as passkeys and session keys. In these circumstances, a mechanism for “relaying” transactions is required.

This is where [Warp](../introduction/rhinestone-intents) comes into play. With one simple unified API, developers can use Rhinestone to upgrade an EOA and relay transactions through a network of solvers with deep liquidity. Whether you are relaying transactions on one chain or across multiple chains, Rhinestone has you covered.

## Key Benefits of EIP-7702

* **Smart EOAs are Cheap (Gas Efficiency)**: EIP-7702 reduces deployment costs by up to 80%, requiring approximately 12,500 gas for proxy setup compared to over 500,000 for traditional smart account deployments.  
* **Seamless User Experience**: Users retain their EOA address, avoiding the need to migrate to a new smart account address, while gaining access to smart account features like transaction batching and gas sponsorship.  
* **Multichain Compatibility**: Authorizations with chainId set to 0 can be replayed across compatible chains, enabling cross-chain operations, though nonce synchronization is required.  
* **Developer Flexibility**: Simplifies integration of complex transaction logic, such as session keys, directly into existing EOAs.

## Use Cases

* **Transaction Batching**: Users can execute multiple actions (e.g., approve and swap tokens) in a single transaction, reducing gas costs and improving user experience.  
* **Gasless Transactions**: Sponsors can cover gas fees on behalf of users, enabling gasless interactions for dApps, such as onboarding new users. Users can also pay for themselves using other tokens like USDC.  
* **Multichain Operations**: Developers can build dApps that execute actions across multiple chains with a single user signature, streamlining cross-chain workflows.  
* **Programmable Permissions**: EOAs can delegate specific actions (e.g., limited spending) to other entities via session keys, enhancing security for recurring transactions.  
* **Use Passkeys**: Developers can use Passkeys to validate transactions, making key management and onchain interactions simple and secure for end users.   
* **Wallet Recovery**: Smart contract logic can enable social recovery mechanisms, allowing users to recover their EOA without relying on traditional seed phrases.
