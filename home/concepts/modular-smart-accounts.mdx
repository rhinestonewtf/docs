A smart account is a smart contract that stores assets for the user and contains the logic for authenticating user signatures and executing transactions. A modular smart account allows signature authentication and transaction execution to be customizable via modules.

## Modules

Modules are self-contained smart contracts that extend a smart account’s feature set. This allows developers to access the programmable signature validation and transaction execution of smart accounts by building a custom module or reusing existing modules. This is a powerful shift in wallet development as it transforms the underlying account contract into an open platform.

There are four types of modules:
- **Validators**: Modifies how transactions are authenticated or what can be authorized against an account. The passkeys module is an example.
- **Executors**: Enables executions on an account with custom logic. For example, this can unlock portfolio management products like a take-profit or stop-loss feature on a DeFi platform.
- **Hooks**: Augment a smart account’s execution flow by hooking in pre- or post-execution and enforcing conditions or any custom logic. A simple example is a spending limit.
- **Fallbacks**: Extends the account logic to add further functionality. For example, this can allow an account to be compatible with new module types in the future.

Smart accounts must always be configured with a signer (which is a validator module). The entity that controls the signer is the entity that owns the account. Typical methods for signing include:
- Passkeys
- Embedded wallets, such as key management providers like Dynamic, Turnkey, or Privy
- External wallets, such as MetaMask or Rabby
